# neutrino-react-reference
A reference implementation for neutrino with React, linting, type checking & decorators. Neutrino.js is a big step forward in reducing config boilerplate. I don't envision this as a boilerplate, but it's still easier to just clone this repo and go. More importantly, it's nice to have a reference implementation to see concretely what the docs are talking about.


[neutrino.js](https://neutrino.js.org) was built to streamline and simplify webpack & babel configuration, something that's always been a drag when setting up a new project.


### TODO:
* Wait until neutrino v5 lands and then update these dependencies. There are several breaking changes.
* Get tcomb runtime validations and type checking running
* Documentation in the readme and in the code
* Add additional linting such as no-unused-styles



### Quick notes (to be expanded on later)
* Can use components with `.js` or `.jsx`
