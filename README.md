# neutrino-react-boilerplate
A boilerplate for the anti-boilerplate toolchain.

### But neutrino is about making it so simple that you don't need a boilerplate. Why?!?
Because it's even easier to just clone this repo and go. Also because it's nice to have a reference implementation to see concretely what the docs are talking about.
