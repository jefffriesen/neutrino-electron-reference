# neutrino-react-boilerplate
A boilerplate for the anti-boilerplate toolchain.

[neutrino.js](https://neutrino.js.org) was built to streamline and simplify a webpack configuration (something that's always been a drag when setting up a new project.)

### But neutrino is about making it so simple that you don't need a boilerplate. Why?!?
Because it's still easier to just clone this repo and go. Also because it's nice to have a reference implementation to see concretely what the docs are talking about.


### TODO:
* Wait until neutrino v5 lands and then update these dependencies. There are several breaking changes.
* Get tcomb runtime validations and type checking running
* Documentation in the readme and in the code
